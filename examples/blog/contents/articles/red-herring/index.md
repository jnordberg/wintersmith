A long time ago, when the world was young
Someone put some food on their tong
They tasted the food, and thought it was nice
Most fruit liked it - but banana's thought twice.

<span class="more"></span>

They held a meeting at quarter past eight
Whilst the human's were getting home late
They decided they didn't want to be eaten
they said "No way, we're not going to be beaten"

So time went by, and human's got old
Banana's got ready, for their prophets had told
That soon shall come the dawn of war.
Where humans will rule the earth no more.

The humans knew not of the evil banana's plans
They made their cars, guitars and aluminum cans
And the banana's began to take over the east
While humans knew not, and kept having their feast.

But time has run out, no more hiding there can be
Or else the banana's will kill George, you and me
We must take up arms, and fight to the end
Because, believe it or not, a banana is not a friend.
